# PS1DiskPart
I was tired of manually formatting USB drives going through CMD to Diskpart and etc. So, I automated the progress with a run BAT and a PS1 script.

Create a BAT file and launch the PS1 or run it in ISE.

This will list the disk current plugged into the system.

Select the disk you would like to format.

Enter a name for the drive.

Sitback and watch it do it's work.
